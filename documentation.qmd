## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

import data

```{r}
library(readxl)

file_path <- "DATASET_V2_RG.xlsx"
if (!file.exists(file_path)) stop("File does not exist")
dataset <- read_excel(file_path)

print(dataset)
```

Next step

```{r}
print("Next step")

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
