## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(readxl)
dataset <- read_excel("DATASET_V2_RG.xlsx")
View(dataset)
```

blabla

```{r}
library(readxl)
dataset <- read_excel("DATASET_V2_RG.xlsx")
DMD <- dataset$ID[dataset$Disease ==1]
count(DMD)

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
